3. Compare and contrast margin, padding, and border.
    Every box in HTML has three properties -- border, margin, and padding -- that can be 
    adjusted to control it's appearance. The border of a box separates the edge of one box
    from another. Thicker border = more space between boxes. Margins are outside 
    of the edge of the border and the width can be set to create a gap between the borders of 
    two adjacent boxes. Lastly, padding is the space between the border of a box and any content
    contained within it. 

4. Define the following flexbox css rules
    https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/:
    a. display: flex
        used to define a flex container and enables a flex context for all it's direct 
        children. The container can be either inline or block based on the given value. 
    b. flex-direction
        defines the direction flex items are placed in the flex container, primarily in
        either horizontal rows or vertical columns. 
    c. flex-wrap
        By default, flex items will all try to fit into one line. This can be changed using 
        flex-wrap which allows the items to wrap as needed. It is possible to have nowrap(default), 
        wrap, and wrap-reverse.   
    d. justify-content/align-items
        justify-content defines the alignment of flex items along the main axis (horizontal or 
        vertical). It helps to distribute any leftover extra free space and control the alignment
        of items when they overflow the line. 
        align-items defines the default for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on
        the current line. Possible alignment option are start, end, center, stretch, and baseline. 
    e. align-content
        aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar
        to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.
