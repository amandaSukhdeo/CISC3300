Homework 4

1. What is HTTP? What are the different HTTP request methods and how do they differ?
    HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) facilitates the transfer of text, images, and 
    other multimedia files between web servers and browsers. The four main HTTP request 
    methods are:
    Get – for retrieving data 
    Post – for submitting data 
    Put – for updating data 
    Delete – for removing data 

2. What is an API? What is JSON?
    APIs are two mechanisms that enable browsers, scripts and websites to share 
    functionality with other programs or sites. APIs all you to wrote code that 
    will make a request, asking another program or script to so something, and 
    allow you to specify the format in which the response will be given (so that 
    it can be understood). 

3. What is AJAX? What is meant by asynchronous code?
    Ajax is a technique that allows you to request data from a server and load it 
    without having to refresh the entire page; the data is often stored in JSON format. 
    Ajax uses an asynchronous processing model. This means that the user can do other 
    things while the browser is waiting for the data to load, speeding up the user experience.
